## Open Annote

<img src="assets/logo_large.png" alt="The Open Annote logo. It looks like a black italicized O with an a superscript in the center of a cream circle." />

Open Annote is an application that allows one to read and create annotated documents, similar to Genius Lyrics, Hypothes.is, and traditional annotated texts such as _The Annotated Shakespeare._ Open Annote is designed to be user-friendly, with GUI design being a major focus of the design. 

### Application Features

- Opens and displays text files and annotation files 
- Creates annotations 
- Loads multiple annotation files on one text file 
- Allows for file creation, thus letting one "import" any text to be used within Open Annote 
- Unique, functional filetype 
- 


### Design Features

- Distinct, colorblind friendly (check terminology) colors 
- Multiple "tabs" allow switching between reading, annotation, and importing documents without confusion 
- Follows norms for PDF readers - text in center, with darkened blank space 
- Text is highly readable, with a large font and a clean background 
- Annotations are shown one at a time in a separate sidebar, which allows for more readable text 
- Responsive program

### Challenges

- The "read" and "annotate" modes look similar. This allows for quicker habituation and learning, but could cause mode errors. 
	- Modes look distinct (different colored highlights, different menu buttons, different controls, separate document loading) 
	- Differing functionality means that the possible damage a mode error could do is minimal 

- Texts can be very large, which can make it difficult to find one's place in a text and (in extreme circumstances) can cause loading issues. 
	- Documents separated into chapters 
	- Scroll within chapter; buttons change chapters 
	- Annotations do not scroll, only change when the corresponding highlighted text is clicked, and close upon chapter change 

- Since this program and its goals are unfamiliar to many people, its controls are guaranteed to be unfamiliar. 
	- User design testing done after prototype completed
	- Current design is a compromise based on testing - a "least bad solution"
